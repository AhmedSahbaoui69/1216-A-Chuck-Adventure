# 1216 : A Chuck McGill Adventure
A Mini game I made in python using the Pygame module.

<summary><b>Context</b></summary>
The inspiration for this game was drawn from a popular scene in the hit TV series "Better Call Saul", specifically S03E05, where Chuck McGill goes into a meltdown and delivers the iconic "Chicanery speech".  

As a fan of the show, I decided to take on a new challenge and put my Python skills to the test by attempting to create a fun 2D-Game project.

## Overview
In order to create this game, I employed the principles of modular programming. This programming approach involves dividing the codebase into independent modules that handle specific functions or tasks. By using this approach, I was able to make the codebase smaller, more manageable, and more readable.
```
Main.py         //Contains the main game loop.
Assets.py       //Handles the game assets, including images, sprite classes, and other resources.
Audio.py        //Handles all game sound effects.
Interface.py    //Manages the game's graphical user interface components.
Particles       //Contains the dust effect particles classes.
```
This approach allowed me to focus on each component separately, making it simpler to debug and optimize.
## Requirements
You only need to have <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> installed as well as the Pygame module.  
I already included a ```requirements.txt``` file so you can load it easily using this command:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
